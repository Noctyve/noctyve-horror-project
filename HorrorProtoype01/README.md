# Horror Prototype 01 — NO SIGNAL

## Goal
Create a short first-person horror experience focused on isolation,
atmosphere, and psychological tension.

## Core Idea
The player is trapped inside an abandoned communications facility.
All signals are dead. Lights flicker. Radios emit distorted sounds.
The fear comes from silence, interference, and the feeling of being watched.

There are some jump scares — tension is mostly built through environment,
audio, and uncertainty.

## Planned Mechanics
- First-person movement
- Flashlight with limited visibility
- Environmental lighting flickers
- Radio or signal device with distorted audio cues
- Ambient sounds triggered by player movement

## Scope (Important)
This prototype is intentionally small:
- One interior location (hallway / control room)
- Some enemies
- No combat
- No UI or menus
- Focus only on atmosphere

## Why I Am Making This
To learn the basics of Unity, C# scripting, and how horror atmosphere
can be created using lighting, sound design, and level layout.
